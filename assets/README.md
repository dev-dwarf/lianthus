# Lianthus
A little over a year ago I released Lianthus: https://dev-dwarf.itch.io/lianthus. It was my first successful project, and I'm extremely grateful for all the opportunities and experience I got from it. To celebrate, Lianthus' code is now licensed under the MIT (Expat) License.
This means you can use the code essentially however you want. Read the full terms here: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT

The project is pretty messy, but I hope its a good reference/example for people getting started.

Also, please wishlist our next game on steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769510/FEWARDVD/
